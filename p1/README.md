- each program has been tested in each case for functionality
- mcat works as intended for each test case provided in submission evalutation
- mgrep works as intended for each test case
- mzip works as intended for each test case
- munzip works as intended for each test case
- mzip is created with the assumption that the user will input the command correctly with shell redirection (i.e. ./mzip targetFile1 targetFile2 ... targetFileN > targetFile.z)
